## Mandatory Installation- Steps

### SDK Installation

#### Installation using Swift Packages Manager

To integrate BlueTriangle using Swift Packages Manager into your iOS project, you need to follow these steps:

 Go to **File > Add Packages…**, enter the package repository URL `https://github.com/blue-triangle-tech/btt-swift-sdk.git`, and click **Add Package**.

 Xcode 11 - 12: go to **File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency…** and enter the package repository URL `https://github.com/blue-triangle-tech/btt-swift-sdk.git`, then follow the instructions.

#### Installation using CocoaPods

To integrate BlueTriangle using CocoaPods into your iOS project, you need to follow these steps:
  
   1. Open 'Podfile' in text mode and add following:
  
   ```
      pod 'BlueTriangleSDK-Swift'     
  ```

   2. Save the Podfile and run the following command in the terminal to install the dependencies:
    
   ```
      pod install     
  ```


### Configuration- Mandatory

In order to use `BlueTriangle`, you need to first configure `BlueTriangle` SDK. To configure it import `BlueTriangle` and call configure function with your siteID. It is recommended to do this in your `AppDelegate.application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)` OR `SceneDelegate.scene(_ scene:, willConnectTo session:, options,connectionOptions:)` method:

```swift
BlueTriangle.configure { config in
    config.siteID = "<MY_SITE_ID>"
}
```

If you are using SwiftUI, it is recommended to add an init() constructor in your App struct and add configuration code there as shown below. 

```swift
import BlueTriangle
import SwiftUI

@main
struct YourApp: App {
    init() {
          
          //Configure BlueTriagle with your siteID
          BlueTriangle.configure { config in
               config.siteID = "<MY_SITE_ID>"
           }
           
           //...
           
    }
    
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView()
        }
    }
}
```

Replace `<BTT_SITE_ID>` with your **site ID**. You can find instructions on how to find your **site ID** [**here**](https://help.bluetriangle.com/hc/en-us/articles/28809592302483-How-to-find-your-Site-ID-for-the-BTT-SDK).

### Privacy Manifest Note

**It is the application developers' responsibility to ensure privacy nutrition labels are according to usage of BlueTriangle SDK in your app. For instance if your app uses revenue tracking(Timers cartValue) its app developers responsibility to mention Purchase History in there apps privacy manifest data usage.** For more detail see [privacy manifest chapter](#privacy-manifest)

### Native View Performance Tracking- Mandatory

All UIKit UIViewControllers view counts will be tracked automatically. You can see each view controller name with their count on our dashboard.

SwiftUI views are not captured automatically. You need to call bttTrackScreen() modifier on each view which you want to track. Below example show usage of "bttTrackScreen(_ screenName: String)" to track About Us screen.

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        VStack{
            Text("Hello, world!")
        }
        .bttTrackScreen("Demo_Screen")
    }
}
```

To disable screen tracking, you need to set the enableScreenTracking configuration to false during configuration like bellow, This will ignore UIViewControllers activities and bttTrackScreen() modifier calls.

```swift
BlueTriangle.configure { config in
         ...
         config.enableScreenTracking = false
 }
```

### Native View/WebView Tracking/Session Stitching- Mandatory

Websites shown in webview that are tracked by BlueTriangle can be tracked in the same session as the native app. To achieve this, follow the steps below to configure the WebView:

Implement WKNavigationDelegate protocol and call BTTWebViewTracker.webView(webView, didCommit: navigation) in 'webView(_:didCommit:)' delegate method as follows.

```swift

import BlueTriangle

  //....

 extension YourWebViewController: WKNavigationDelegate{

  //....

  func webView(_ webView: WKWebView, didCommit navigation: WKNavigation!) {

      //....

      //Call BlueTringles 'webView(_:didCommit:)' method
      BTTWebViewTracker.webView(webView, didCommit: navigation)
    }

 }
```

For more clarity, here is a Webview with UIViewController full example:

```swift

import UIKit
import WebKit
//Need to import BlueTriangle
import BlueTriangle

class YourWebViewController: UIViewController {
  @IBOutlet weak var webView: WKWebView!

  override func viewDidLoad() {
      super.viewDidLoad()

      //Set navigationDelegate
      webView.navigationDelegate = self

      //Load Url
      if let htmlURL = URL(string: "https://example.com"){
          webView.load(URLRequest(url: htmlURL))
      }
  }
}

//Implement Navigation Delagate
extension YourWebViewController: WKNavigationDelegate {

  func webView(_ webView: WKWebView, didCommit navigation: WKNavigation!) {

      //...

      //Call BlueTringles 'webView(_:didCommit:)' method
      BTTWebViewTracker.webView(webView, didCommit: navigation)
  }
}

```

Webview with SwiftUI full example:

```swift

import SwiftUI
import WebKit
//Need to import BlueTriangle
import BlueTriangle

struct YourWebView: UIViewRepresentable {

  private let webView = WKWebView()

  func makeCoordinator() -> YourWebView.Coordinator {
      Coordinator()
  }

  func makeUIView(context: Context) -> some UIView {

      //Set navigationDelegate
      webView.navigationDelegate = context.coordinator

      //Load Url
      if let htmlURL = URL(string: "https://example.com"){
          webView.load(URLRequest(url: htmlURL))
      }
      return webView
  }
}

extension YourWebView {

  //Implement Navigation Delegate  Coordinator

  class Coordinator: NSObject, WKNavigationDelegate {

      func webView(_ webView: WKWebView, didCommit navigation: WKNavigation!) {

          //...

          //Call BlueTringles 'webView(_:didCommit:)' method
          BTTWebViewTracker.webView(webView, didCommit: navigation)
      }
  }
}

```

### Network Capture- Mandatory

The Blue Triangle SDK supports capturing network requests using either the bt-prefixed URLSession methods or the NetworkCaptureSessionDelegate.

Network requests using a URLSession with a NetworkCaptureSessionDelegate or made with one of the bt-prefixed URLSession methods will be associated with the last main timer to have been started at the time a request completes. Note that requests are only captured after at least one main timer has been started and they are not associated with a timer until the request ends.

#### NetworkCaptureSessionDelegate

You can use NetworkCaptureSessionDelegate or a subclass as your URLSession delegate to gather information about network requests when network capture is enabled:

```swift
let sesssion = URLSession(
    configuration: .default,
    delegate: NetworkCaptureSessionDelegate(),
    delegateQueue: nil)

let timer = BlueTriangle.startTimer(page: Page(pageName: "MY_PAGE"))
...
let (data, response) = try await session.data(from: URL(string: "https://example.com")!)
```

If you have already implemented and set URLSessionDelegate to URLSession, you can call NetworkCaptureSessionDelegate objects urlSession(session: task: didFinishCollecting:) method:


```swift
    func urlSession(_ session: URLSession, task: URLSessionTask, didFinishCollecting metrics: URLSessionTaskMetrics) {

     //Your code ...

    let sessionDelegate = NetworkCaptureSessionDelegate()
    sessionDelegate.urlSession(session, task: task, didFinishCollecting: metrics)
}
```

#### URLSession Methods

Alternatively, use bt-prefixed URLSession methods to capture network requests:

| Standard                                     | Network Capture                                |  
|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| URLSession.dataTask(with:completionHandler:) | URLSession.btDataTask(with:completionHandler:) | 
| URLSession.data(for:delegate:)               | URLSession.btData(for:delegate:)               | 
| URLSession.dataTaskPublisher(for:)           | URLSession.btDataTaskPublisher(for:)           | 

Use these methods just as you would their standard counterparts:

```swift

let timer = BlueTriangle.startTimer(page: Page(pageName: "MY_PAGE"))
...
URLSession.shared.btDataTask(with: URL(string: "https://example.com")!) { data, response, error in
    // ...
}.resume()

```

### Manual Network Capture

For other network capture requirements, captured requests can be manually created and submitted to the tracker.

**If you have the URL, method, and requestBodyLength in the request, and httpStatusCode, responseBodyLength, and contentType in the response**
```swift

let tracker = NetworkCaptureTracker.init(url: "https://example.com", method: "post", requestBodylength: 9130)
tracker.submit(200, responseBodyLength: 11120, contentType: "json")

```

**If you have urlRequest in request and urlResponse in response**

```swift

let tracker = NetworkCaptureTracker.init(request: urlRequest)
tracker.submit(urlResponse)

```
where urlRequest and urlResponse are of URLRequest and URLResponse types, respectively.

**If you encounter an error during a network call**

```swift
let tracker = NetworkCaptureTracker.init(url: "https://example.com", method: "post", requestBodylength: 9130)
tracker.failed(error)

```
        OR
```swift
let tracker = NetworkCaptureTracker.init(request: urlRequest)
tracker.failed(error)

```





## Timers

To measure the duration of a user interaction, initialize a `Page` object describing that interaction and pass it to `BlueTriangle.startTimer(page:timerType)` to receive a running timer instance.

```swift
let page = Page(pageName: "MY_PAGE")
let timer = BlueTriangle.startTimer(page: page)
```

If you need to defer the start of the timer, pass your `Page` instance to `BlueTriangle.makeTimer(page:timerType)` and call the timer's `start()` method when you are ready to start timing:

```swift
let page = Page(pageName: "MY_PAGE")
let timer = BlueTriangle.makeTimer(page: page)
...
timer.start()
```

In both cases, pass your timer to `BlueTriangle.endTimer(_:purchaseConfirmation:)` to send it to the Blue Triangle server.

```swift
BlueTriangle.endTimer(timer)
```

Running timers are automatically stopped when passed to `BlueTriangle.endTimer(_:purchaseConfirmation:)`, though you can end timing earlier by calling the timer's `end()` method.

```swift
timer.end()
...
// You must still pass the timer to `BlueTriangle.endTimer(_:)` to send it to the Blue Triangle server
BlueTriangle.endTimer(timer)
```

For timers that are associated with checkout, create a `PurchaseConfirmation` object to pass along with the timer to `BlueTriangle.endTimer(_:purchaseConfirmation:)`:

```swift
timer.end()
let purchaseConfirmation = PurchaseConfirmation(cartValue: 99.00)
BlueTriangle.endTimer(timer, purchaseConfirmation: purchaseConfirmation)
```

### Timer Types

`BlueTriangle.makeTimer(page:timerType:)` and `BlueTriangle.startTimer(page:timerType:)` have a `timerType` parameter to specify the type of the timer they return. By default, both methods return main timers with the type `BTTimer.TimerType.main`. When network capture is enabled, requests made with one of the `bt`-prefixed `URLSession` methods will be associated with the last main timer to have been started at the time the request completes. It is recommended to only have a single main timer running at any given time. If you need overlapping timers, create additional custom timers by specifying a `BTTimer.TimerType.custom` timer type:

```swift
let mainTimer = BlueTriangle.startTimer(page: Page(pageName: "MY_PAGE"))
let customTimer = BlueTriangle.startTimer(page: Page(pageName: "MY_OTHER_TIMER"), timerType: .custom)
// ...
BlueTriangle.endTimer(mainTimer)
// ...
BlueTriangle.endTimer(customTimer)
```

## Network Capture

The Blue Triangle SDK supports capturing network requests using either the `NetworkCaptureSessionDelegate` or `bt`-prefixed `URLSession` methods.

Network requests using a `URLSession` with a `NetworkCaptureSessionDelegate` or made with one of the `bt`-prefixed `URLSession` methods will be associated with the last main timer to have been started at the time a request completes. Note that requests are only captured after at least one main timer has been started and they are not associated with a timer until the request ends.

### `NetworkCaptureSessionDelegate`

You can use `NetworkCaptureSessionDelegate` or a subclass as your `URLSession` delegate to gather information about network requests when network capture is enabled:

```swift
let sesssion = URLSession(
    configuration: .default,
    delegate: NetworkCaptureSessionDelegate(),
    delegateQueue: nil)

let timer = BlueTriangle.startTimer(page: Page(pageName: "MY_PAGE"))
...
let (data, response) = try await session.data(from: URL(string: "https://example.com")!)
```

if you have already implemented and set URLSessionDelegate to URLSession. You can call  NetworkCaptureSessionDelegate objects urlSession(session: task: didFinishCollecting:) method like bellow.

```swift
    func urlSession(_ session: URLSession, task: URLSessionTask, didFinishCollecting metrics: URLSessionTaskMetrics) {
     
     //Your code ...
     
    let sessionDelegate = NetworkCaptureSessionDelegate()
    sessionDelegate.urlSession(session, task: task, didFinishCollecting: metrics)
}
```

### `URLSession` Methods

Alternatively, use `bt`-prefixed `URLSession` methods to capture network requests:

| Standard                                       | Network Capture                                  |
| :--                                            | :--                                              |
| `URLSession.dataTask(with:completionHandler:)` | `URLSession.btDataTask(with:completionHandler:)` |
| `URLSession.data(for:delegate:)`               | `URLSession.btData(for:delegate:)`               |
| `URLSession.dataTaskPublisher(for:)`           | `URLSession.btDataTaskPublisher(for:)`           |

Use these methods just as you would their standard counterparts:

```swift
let timer = BlueTriangle.startTimer(page: Page(pageName: "MY_PAGE"))
...
URLSession.shared.btDataTask(with: URL(string: "https://example.com")!) { data, response, error in
    // ...
}.resume()
```

### Mannual Network Capture

For other network capture requirements, captured requests can be manually created and submitted to the tracker.

#### If you have the URL, method, and requestBodyLength in the request, and httpStatusCode, responseBodyLength, and contentType in the response 

```swift
let tracker = NetworkCaptureTracker.init(url: "https://example.com", method: "post", requestBodylength: 9130)
tracker.submit(200, responseBodyLength: 11120, contentType: "json")
```

#### If you have urlRequest in request and urlResponse in response

```swift
let tracker = NetworkCaptureTracker.init(request: urlRequest)
tracker.submit(urlResponse) 
```
where urlRequest and urlResponse are of URLRequest and URLResponse types, respectively

#### If you encounters an error during a network call

```swift
let tracker = NetworkCaptureTracker.init(url: "https://example.com", method: "post", requestBodylength: 9130)
tracker.failled(error)
        
        OR 
        
let tracker = NetworkCaptureTracker.init(request: urlRequest)
tracker.failled(error) 

```

### Network Capture Sample Rate

Network sample rate indicate how many percent session  network request are captured. For exampme a value of `0.05` means that network capture will be randomly enabled for 5% of user sessions. Network sample rate value should be between 0.0 to 1.0 representing fraction value of percent 0 to 100.

The default networkSampleRate value is 0.05, i.e  only 5% of sessions network request are captured.

To change network capture sample rate set value to 'config.networkSampleRate' during configuration like bellow code sets sample rate to 50%.

```swift
BlueTriangle.configure { config in
    config.siteID = "<MY_SITE_ID>"
    config.networkSampleRate = 0.5
    ...
}
```

To dissable network capture set 0.0 to 'config.networkSampleRate' during configuration.

It is recomended to have 100% sample rate while developing/debuging. By setting 'config.networkSampleRate' to 1.0 during configuration.

## Screen View Tracking

All UIKit UIViewControllers view count tracked automatically. You can see each view controller name with there count on our dashboard.

SwiftUI views are not captured automatically. You need to call bttTrackScreen(<screen Name>) modifier on each view which you want to track. Below example show usage of "bttTrackScreen(_ screenName: String)" to track About Us screen.

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        VStack{
            Text("Hello, world!")
        }
        .bttTrackScreen("Demo_Screen")
    }
}
```

To dissable screen tracking, You need to set the enableScreenTracking configuration to false during configuration like bellow, This will ignore UIViewControllers activities and bttTrackScreen() modifier calls.

```swift
 BlueTriangle.configure { config in
         ...
         config.enableScreenTracking = false
 }
```

## ANR Detection

BlueTriangle tracks Apps repulsiveness by monitoring main THREAD USAGE. If any task blocking main thread for extended period of time causing app not responding, will be tracked as ANR Morning. By default this time interval is 5 Sec I.e. if any task blocking main thread more then 5 sec will be triggered as ANRWorning. This timinterval can be changed using "ANRWarningTimeInterval" Property below.  

 ```swift
 BlueTriangle.configure { config in
         ...
        config.ANRWarningTimeInterval = 3
 }
```

You can disable it by setting "ANRMonitoring" configuration property to "false" during configuration.
 
 ```swift
 BlueTriangle.configure { config in
         ...
         config.ANRMonitoring = false
 }
```

### Memory Warning

Blue Triangle track ios reported low memory warning. By monitoring UIApplication.didReceiveMemoryWarningNotification Notification.

You can disable it by setting "enableMemoryWarning" configuration property to "false" during configuration.
 
 ```swift
 BlueTriangle.configure { config in
         ...
         config.enableMemoryWarning = false
 }
```

## Network State Capture

 BlueTriangle SDK allows capturing of network state data. Network state refers to the availability of any network interfaces on the device. Network interfaces include wifi, ethernet, cellular, etc. Once Network state capturing is enabled, the Network state is associated with all Timers, Errors and Network Requests captured by the SDK. This feature is enabled by default.

You can disable it by setting enableTrackingNetworkState property to "false" during configuration.

```swift
 BlueTriangle.configure { config in
         ...
         config.enableTrackingNetworkState = false
  }
```


## Offline Caching

Offline caching is a feature that allows the BTT sdk to keep track of timers and other analytics data while the app is
in offline mode. i.e, the BTT sdk cannot access the tracker urls.

There is a memory limit as well as an expiration duration put on the cached data. If the cache exceeds the memory limit
then additional tracker data will be added only after removing some old cached data. Similarly, cache data that has been
stored for longer than the expiration duration would be discarded and won't be sent to the tracker server.

Memory limit and Expiry Duration can be set by using configuration property cacheMemoryLimit and cacheExpiryDuration as shown bellow:``
    
```swift
 BlueTriangle.configure { config in
         ...
            config.cacheMemoryLimit = 50 * 1024 (Bytes)
            config.cacheExpiryDuration = 50 * 60 * 1000 (Milisecond)
 }
```

By default, the cacheMemoryLimit is set to 2 days and cacheExpiryDuration is set to 30 MB.


## WebView Tracking

Websites shown in webview  that are tracked by BlueTriangle can be tracked in the same session as the native app. To achieve this, follow the steps below to configure the WebView:

Implement WKNavigationDelegate protocol and  call  BTTWebViewTracker.webView(webView, didCommit: navigation) in 'webView(_:didCommit:)' delegate method as follows. 

  ```swift
    import BlueTriangle
   
    //....
   
   extension YourWebViewController: WKNavigationDelegate{
   
    //....
    
    func webView(_ webView: WKWebView, didCommit navigation: WKNavigation!) {
        
        //....
        
        //Call BlueTringles 'webView(_:didCommit:)' method
        BTTWebViewTracker.webView(webView, didCommit: navigation)
      }
    
   }
   
  ``` 

See below full example code for more clarity

Webviw with UIViewController full example
  ```swift
  
import UIKit
import WebKit
//Need to import BlueTriagle
import BlueTriangle

class YourWebViewController: UIViewController {

    @IBOutlet weak var webView: WKWebView!
    
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        
        //Set navigationDelegate
        webView.navigationDelegate = self
        
        //Load Url
        if let htmlURL = URL(string: "https://example.com"){
            webView.load(URLRequest(url: htmlURL))
        }
    }
}

//Implement Navigation Delagate
extension YourWebViewController: WKNavigationDelegate {
    
    func webView(_ webView: WKWebView, didCommit navigation: WKNavigation!) {
        
        //...
        
        //Call BlueTringles 'webView(_:didCommit:)' method
        BTTWebViewTracker.webView(webView, didCommit: navigation)
    }
}

  ``` 

Webviw with SwiftUI full example

  ```swift
  
import SwiftUI
import WebKit
//Need to import BlueTriagle
import BlueTriangle

struct YourWebView: UIViewRepresentable {
   
    private let webView = WKWebView()
    
    func makeCoordinator() -> YourWebView.Coordinator {
        Coordinator()
    }

    func makeUIView(context: Context) -> some UIView {
    
        //Set navigationDelegate
        webView.navigationDelegate = context.coordinator
        
        //Load Url
        if let htmlURL = URL(string: "https://example.com"){
            webView.load(URLRequest(url: htmlURL))
        }
        return webView
    }
}

extension YourWebView {
    
    //Implement Navigation Delagate  Coordinator
    
    class Coordinator: NSObject, WKNavigationDelegate {
       
        func webView(_ webView: WKWebView, didCommit navigation: WKNavigation!) {
           
            //...
            
            //Call BlueTringles 'webView(_:didCommit:)' method
            BTTWebViewTracker.webView(webView, didCommit: navigation)
        }
    }
}
  ``` 

## Privacy Manifest

**It is the application developer's responsibility to ensure that the privacy nutrition labels are used according to the configuration and usage of the BlueTriangle SDK in your application. For instance, if your application uses revenue tracking, then it is the application developer's responsibility to mention Purchase History in their application's Privacy Manifest data usage.**

 Depending on how App developers are utilizing the BlueTriangle SDK's configurable features, it is their responsibility to accurately mention their apps data uses in the Privacy Manifest. The table below shows each BlueTriangle feature and their applicable data nutrition label data type: 
 

| #  | **DATA TYPE**               | **LINKED** | **TRACKING** |   **PURPOSE**        |  **BTT Feature**                                                                                 |
|----|-----------------------------|---------   |--------------|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1. | Purchase history            |     NO     |  NO          |   Analytics          | if app using cartValue(PurchaseConfirmation) to our timer.                                        |
| 2. | Product interaction         |     NO     |  NO          |   App Functionality  | if app using timers to track user action like button tap.                                        |
| 3. | Crash data                  |     NO     |  NO          |   App Functionality  | if app using crash tracking feature of Blue Triangle SDK.                                        |
| 4. | Performance data            |     NO     |  NO          |   App Functionality  | if app using performance data(memory and CPU) and ANR feature of Blue Triangle SDK.               |
| 5. | Other diagnostic data       |     NO     |  NO          |   App Functionality  | if app using any of the feature like timer and screen tracking etc.                               |

BlueTriangle tracks app launch performance. Launch time refers to the duration it takes for an app to become ready for user interaction after it has been started. BlueTriangle automatically tracks both hot launch and cold launch.


### Cold Launch

 A cold launch is launch when app process was already not in main memory. This can happen because iOS or user terminated your apps process or its first time launch after install/update/reboot.

 The BlueTriangle SDK measures the cold launch latency, which is the time between the process start time and end of 'applicationDidBecomeActive(:)'. So that cold launch time is cumulative time taken to load the process and time taken by 'application(:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)', 'applicationWillEnterForeground(:)' and 'applicationDidBecomeActive(:)'.
   
### Hot Launch

  A hot launch is launch when app process was already in main memory. This can happen when user launches the app from the background.
 
  The BlueTriangle SDK measures the hot launch latency, which is the time between the end of 'applicationWillEnterForeground(:)' and end of 'applicationDidBecomeActive(:)'. So that hot launch time taken by 'applicationDidBecomeActive(:)'.

  When user lock the device while app was on screen and unlocks it iOS gives background and forground notification. Hence unclocking followed by lock while app was active is tracked as Hot Launch

You can disable it by setting "enableLaunchTime" configuration property to "false" during configuration. like
 
 ```swift
 BlueTriangle.configure { config in
         ...
         config.enableLaunchTime = false
 }
```
