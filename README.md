Xcode 11 - 12: go to **File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency…** and enter the package repository URL `https://github.com/blue-triangle-tech/btt-swift-sdk.git`, then follow the instructions.

## Usage

### Configuration

Before sending timers you must first configure `BlueTriangle`. It is recommended to do this in your `AppDelegate.application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)` method:

```swift
BlueTriangle.configure { config in
    config.siteID = "MY_SITE_ID"
    config.isReturningVisitor = true
    config.abTestID = "MY_AB_TEST_ID"
    config.campaignMedium = "MY_CAMPAIGN_MEDIUM"
    config.campaignName = "MY_CAMPAIGN_NAME"
    config.campaignSource = "MY_CAMPAIGN_SOURCE"
    config.dataCenter = "MY_DATA_CENTER"
    config.trafficSegmentName = "MY_SEGMENT_NAME"
    config.crashTracking = .nsException
    config.performanceMonitorSampleRate = 1.0
}
```

### Timers

To measure the duration of a user interaction, initialize a `Page` object describing that interaction and pass it to `BlueTriangle.startTimer(page:timerType)` to receive a running timer instance.

```swift
let page = Page(pageName: "MY_PAGE")
let timer = BlueTriangle.startTimer(page: page)
```

If you need to defer the start of the timer, pass your `Page` instance to `BlueTriangle.makeTimer(page:timerType)` and call the timer's `start()` method when you are ready to start timing:

```swift
let page = Page(pageName: "MY_PAGE")
let timer = BlueTriangle.makeTimer(page: page)
...
timer.start()
```

In both cases, pass your timer to `BlueTriangle.endTimer(_:purchaseConfirmation:)` to send it to the Blue Triangle server.

```swift
BlueTriangle.endTimer(timer)
```

Running timers are automatically stopped when passed to `BlueTriangle.endTimer(_:purchaseConfirmation:)`, though you can end timing earlier by calling the timer's `end()` method.

```swift
timer.end()
...
// You must still pass the timer to `BlueTriangle.endTimer(_:)` to send it to the Blue Triangle server
BlueTriangle.endTimer(timer)
```

For timers that are associated with checkout, create a `PurchaseConfirmation` object to pass along with the timer to `BlueTriangle.endTimer(_:purchaseConfirmation:)`:

```swift
timer.end()
let purchaseConfirmation = PurchaseConfirmation(cartValue: 99.00)
BlueTriangle.endTimer(timer, purchaseConfirmation: purchaseConfirmation)
```

#### Timer Types

`BlueTriangle.makeTimer(page:timerType:)` and `BlueTriangle.startTimer(page:timerType:)` have a `timerType` parameter to specify the type of the timer they return. By default, both methods return main timers with the type `BTTimer.TimerType.main`. When network capture is enabled, requests made with one of the `bt`-prefixed `URLSession` methods will be associated with the last main timer to have been started at the time the request completes. It is recommended to only have a single main timer running at any given time. If you need overlapping timers, create additional custom timers by specifying a `BTTimer.TimerType.custom` timer type:

```swift
let mainTimer = BlueTriangle.startTimer(page: Page(pageName: "MY_PAGE"))
let customTimer = BlueTriangle.startTimer(page: Page(pageName: "MY_OTHER_TIMER"), timerType: .custom)
// ...
BlueTriangle.endTimer(mainTimer)
// ...
BlueTriangle.endTimer(customTimer)
```

### Network Capture

The Blue Triangle SDK supports capturing network requests using either the `NetworkCaptureSessionDelegate` or `bt`-prefixed `URLSession` methods.

To enable network capture, first configure the SDK with a non-zero network sample rate:

```swift
BlueTriangle.configure { config in
    ...
    config.networkSampleRate = 0.05
}
```

A value of `0.05`, for example, means that network capture will be randomly enabled for 5% of user sessions. Network requests using a `URLSession` with a `NetworkCaptureSessionDelegate` or made with one of the `bt`-prefixed `URLSession` methods will be associated with the last main timer to have been started at the time a request completes. Note that requests are only captured after at least one main timer has been started and they are not associated with a timer until the request ends.

#### `NetworkCaptureSessionDelegate`

You can use `NetworkCaptureSessionDelegate` or a subclass as your `URLSession` delegate to gather information about network requests when network capture is enabled:

```swift
let sesssion = URLSession(
    configuration: .default,
    delegate: NetworkCaptureSessionDelegate(),
    delegateQueue: nil)

let timer = BlueTriangle.startTimer(page: Page(pageName: "MY_PAGE"))
...
let (data, response) = try await session.data(from: URL(string: "https://example.com")!)
```

#### `URLSession` Methods

Alternatively, use `bt`-prefixed `URLSession` methods to capture network requests:

| Standard                                       | Network Capture                                  |
| :--                                            | :--                                              |
| `URLSession.dataTask(with:completionHandler:)` | `URLSession.btDataTask(with:completionHandler:)` |
| `URLSession.data(for:delegate:)`               | `URLSession.btData(for:delegate:)`               |
| `URLSession.dataTaskPublisher(for:)`           | `URLSession.btDataTaskPublisher(for:)`           |

Use these methods just as you would their standard counterparts:

```swift
let timer = BlueTriangle.startTimer(page: Page(pageName: "MY_PAGE"))
...
URLSession.shared.btDataTask(with: URL(string: "https://example.com")!) { data, response, error in
    // ...
}.resume()
```
